        <h1>Teaching Philosophy</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          I believe that language learning is a deeply important social process. By interacting with meaningful content and
          with each other, students develop language and life skills—confidence, problem‑solving, and collaboration.
        </p>

        <h2>My core beliefs</h2>
        <p>
          Every lesson should be <strong>student‑centered</strong>. This means students do much of the talking—discussing,
          exploring ideas, and solving problems—while I act as a <strong>facilitator and guide</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also believe the classroom should be a <strong>safe place</strong>, where every student can share ideas
          confidently without anxiety about making mistakes or offering non‑standard opinions.
        </p>

        <h2>How I put this into practice</h2>
        <div class="callouts">
          <section class="callout">
            <h3>1) Task‑Based Learning (TBLT)</h3>
            <p>
              I don’t teach grammar rules first. Instead, I give students <strong>group tasks</strong> that lead them toward a new grammar topic.
              Learners work together to <strong>discover patterns</strong> and form rules through meaningful use of language.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="callout">
            <h3>2) Delayed feedback</h3>
            <p>
              If students say something incorrectly, I avoid interrupting them to fix every mistake. During tasks I note common errors,
              and we discuss them together at the end of the lesson. This supports fluency and helps learners become more independent.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="callout">
            <h3>3) Inclusive scaffolding</h3>
            <p>
              I make lessons inclusive by providing scaffolds such as visuals, sentence starters, and useful phrases—so even lower‑level students
              can participate confidently in pair and group discussions.
            </p>
          </section>

        <h2>MA TESOL direction</h2>
        <p>
          These practices show how my MA TESOL program is helping me move from traditional teacher‑centered lessons to modern, interactive teaching.
          My goal is to combine learner‑centred pedagogy with appropriate digital tools to make lessons more engaging and meaningful.
