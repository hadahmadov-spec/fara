        <h1>Teaching Philosophy</h1>
        <p class="lead">
          I believe language learning is a deeply social process. When students interact with meaningful content
          and with each other, they develop not only language, but also key life skills—collaboration, problem‑solving,
          confidence, and empathy.
        </p>

        <h2>What I believe</h2>
        <p>
          Every lesson should be <strong>student‑centred</strong>. This means students do much of the talking—discussing,
          exploring ideas, and solving problems—while I act as a <strong>facilitator and guide</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also believe the classroom should be a <strong>safe space</strong>, where every student can share ideas
          confidently without anxiety about making mistakes or offering non‑standard opinions.
        </p>

        <h2>How I put it into practice</h2>

        <div class="callouts">
          <section class="callout">
            <h3>1) Task‑Based Learning (TBLT)</h3>
            <p>
              Instead of teaching grammar rules first, I design <strong>group tasks</strong> that lead students toward the new topic.
              Students try to <strong>discover patterns</strong> and form rules together through collaboration.
              This keeps learning active and makes grammar meaningful.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="callout">
            <h3>2) Delayed feedback</h3>
            <p>
              When students speak, I avoid interrupting them to correct every mistake. During activities I note common errors,
              and at the end of the lesson we discuss them together. This helps learners reflect on their language,
              correct themselves, and become more independent.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="callout">
            <h3>3) Inclusive scaffolding</h3>
            <p>
              I support participation by providing scaffolds such as visuals, sentence starters, and useful phrases.
              This ensures that even students with lower proficiency can contribute to discussions and group tasks.
            </p>
          </section>

        <h2>Where I am heading</h2>
        <p>
          These practices reflect how my MA TESOL studies are helping me move from traditional teacher‑centred instruction
          toward modern, interactive teaching. In today’s technology‑rich world, I aim to combine learner‑centred pedagogy
          with appropriate digital tools to make lessons engaging, inclusive, and effective.
